    PowerShell Community Extensions (version 2.0.0.0)

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the Windows PowerShell Community Extensions (PSCX) module and 
    how to use the contained cmdlets and functions.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell Community Extensions is a PowerShell module that provides a
    number of widely useful cmdlets.  PSCX is not affiliated with Microsoft 
    or the Windows PowerShell team at Microsoft.  We are a few (at the moment)
    passionate PowerShell users who wanted more cmdlets than Microsoft was 
    able to deliver in v1 and v2.  So we have taken it upon ourselves to
    create some of those cmdlets and make them available to the community.
        
POWERSHELL COMPATIBILITY
    Since PSCX 2.0 is module based, it only works on Windows PowerShell 2.0.  
    There are three PSCX cmdlets that override PowerShell 2.0 built-in cmdlets
    with the same names. Those cmdlets are:
    
    Get-Random
    Start-Process
    Select-Xml
    
    These cmdlets are provided via the Pscx.Deprecated module.  If you have
    scripts that require the PSCX version of these cmdlets then import
    the Pscx.Deprecated module.  If you import this module, these three 
    PSCX cmdlets will hide the built-in ones.  If you would prefer to use the 
    built-in versions in certain places, you can access them as shown below:
    
    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Get-Random
    Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\Start-Process
    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Select-Xml
    
    In order to get the help topic for these built-in cmdlets, use the 
    qualified name when accessing help e.g.:
    
    PS> Get-Help Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Select-Xml -Full
    
    Finally, there is an alias defined for the Start-Process by PowerShell.
    Since the Pscx.Deprecated\Start-Process overrides the built-in 
    Start-Process, the alias will now resolve to the 
    Pscx.Deprecated\Start-Process. If you want to redirect the start alias
    back to the built-in Start-Process cmdlet, execute the following:
    
    PS> Set-Alias start Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\Start-Process 
        -Option AllScope
    
PREFERENCE VARIABLES
    Previous versions of PSCX used global variables to store preference 
    information and variables created by PSCX functions.  Those have been 
    moved to the PSCX settings provider.  PSCX will no longer create any 
    variables in your global variable scope.  All PSCX preference settings 
    are now specified using the Pscx.UserPreferencs.ps1 file.  The file is 
    located in the root of the PSCX module folder.  Its default values 
    indicate the defaults used if no preference file is specified during 
    import of the PSCX module.  If you want to change any of the defaults, 
    then copy this file to your home dir, edit it and then import PSCX using 
    the -ArgumentList to specify the path to your updated 
    Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1 file e.g.:
    
    Import-Module Pscx -arg ~\Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1
    
    The preference variables and default values are:
    
    ShowModuleLoadDetails = $false # Display module load details during 
                                   # Import-Module.
    
    CD_GetChildItem = $false       # Display the contents of new provider 
                                   # location after using cd (Set-LocationEx).
                                   # Mutually exclusive with 
                                   # CD_EchoNewLocation.
                                   
    CD_EchoNewLocation = $true     # Display new provider location after using 
                                   # cd (Set-LocationEx).
                                   # Mutually exclusive with CD_GetChildItem.
    
    TextEditor = 'Notepad.exe'     # Default text editor used by the Edit-File
                                   # function.
    
    PromptTheme = 'Modern'         # Prompt string and window title updates.  
                                   # To enable, first set the ModulesToImport 
                                   # setting for Prompt below to $true.
                                   # Then set this value to one of: 'Modern', 
                                   # 'WinXP' or 'Jachym'.
    
    PageHelpUsingLess = $true      # Pscx replaces PowerShell's More function.
                                   # When this setting is set to $true, 
                                   # less.exe is used to page items piped to 
                                   # the More function. Less.exe is powerful 
                                   # paging app that allows advanced 
                                   # navigation and search. Press 'h' to 
                                   # access help inside less.exe and 'q' to 
                                   # exit less.exe. Set this setting to $false
                                   # to use more.com for paging.
                                   
    SmtpFrom = $null               # These settings are used by the PSCX 
                                   # Send-SmtpMail cmdlet.
    SmtpHost = $null               # Specify a default SMTP server.
    SmtpPort = $null               # Specify a default port number.  If not 
                                   # specified port 25 is used.
                                   
    FileSizeInUnits = $false       # Pscx can prepend format data for the 
                                   # display of file information. If this 
                                   # value is set to $true, file sizes are 
                                   # displayed in using KB,MG,GB and TB units.
                                      

CMDLETS
    To see what cmdlets are provided by PSCX, execute the alias "gcmpscx" at
    the PowerShell prompt.  The current PSCX cmdlets are listed below:

    Get-ADObject
        Search for objects in the Active Directory/Global Catalog. 
        
    Invoke-AdoCommand
        Execute a SQL query against an ADO.NET datasource. 
        
    Get-AdoConnection
        Create an ADO connection to any database supported by .NET on the current 
        machine. You can enumerate available ADO.NET Data Providers with the 
        Get-AdoDataProvider Cmdlet.Data connections to supported providers are 
        constructed using provider-agnostic common parameters like Server, 
        Username, Password etc. 
        
    Get-AdoDataProvider
        List all registered ADO.NET Data Providers on the current machine. 
        
    Get-AlternateDataStream
        Gets the alternate data streams in an NTFS file. Use the List parameter 
        to list all the alternate data streams. 
        
    Remove-AlternateDataStream
        Removes the specified alternate data streams from an NTFS file. 
        
    Test-AlternateDataStream
        Tests for the existence of the specified alternate data stream from an 
        NTFS file. 
        
    Invoke-Apartment
        
    Expand-Archive
        Expands a compressed archive file, or ArchiveEntry object, to its 
        constituent file(s). 
        
    Read-Archive
        Enumerates compressed archives such as 7z or rar, emitting ArchiveEntry 
        objects representing records in the archive.Read-Archive is used to list 
        the contents of a compressed archive containing one or more compressed 
        file(s). The format of the file being read can be overriden with the 
        Format parameter, for example to enumerate the contents of a 
        self-extracting archive (EXE).Read-Archive is useful if you wish to 
        perform filtering using standard pipeline Where-Object and/or 
        ForEach-Object cmdlets before piping ArchiveEntry objects to 
        Expand-Archive. 
        
    Test-Assembly
        Tests whether or not the specified file is a .NET assembly. 
        
    ConvertFrom-Base64
        Converts base64 encoded string to byte array. 
        
    ConvertTo-Base64
        Converts byte array or specified file contents to base64 string. By 
        default, this cmdlet inserts line breaks every 76 characters and outputs 
        the result in a single string. For very large files, you may run into 
        OutOfMemoryExceptions. In this case, use the -Stream parameter which will 
        generate multiple string outputs that, combined together, result in the 
        equivalent base 64 text. 
        
    Export-Bitmap
        Exports a bitmap object to a specified file format. 
        
    Import-Bitmap
        Loads bitmap files. 
        
    Set-BitmapSize
        Sets the size of the specified bitmap. 
        
    Format-Byte
        Turns numbers into nicely formatted byte count, using the highest 
        possible unit. 
        
    Write-BZip2
        Create BZIP2 format archive files from pipline or parameter input. 
        
    Get-Clipboard
        Gets data from the clipboard. 
        
    Out-Clipboard
        Formats text via Out-String before placing in clipboard. Can also place 
        string in clipboard as a file. 
        
    Set-Clipboard
        Puts the specified object into the system clipboard. 
        
    Write-Clipboard
        Writes objects to the clipboard using their string representation, 
        bypassing the default PowerShell formatting. 
        
    Get-DhcpServer
        Gets a list of authorized DHCP servers. 
        
    Get-DomainController
        Gets all domain controllers at the specified scope. 
        
    Get-DriveInfo
        Gets disk usage information on the system's disk drives. 
        
    Get-EnvironmentBlock
        Lists the environment blocks stored on the environment block stack. 
        
    Pop-EnvironmentBlock
        Pops the environment block and restores the state of all environment 
        variables to the values stored in the environment block. 
        
    Push-EnvironmentBlock
        Stores the state of all environment variables into an environment block 
        and pushes that onto the environment block stack. 
        
    Unblock-File
        Unblock the file so that it can be used locally. 
        
    Get-FileTail
        This implentation efficiently tails the cotents of a file by reading 
        lines from the end rather then processing the entire file. This behavior 
        is crucial for efficiently tailing large log files and large log files 
        over a network. You can also specify the Wait parameter to have the 
        cmdlet wait and display new content as it is written to the file. Use 
        Ctrl+C to break out of the wait loop. Note that if an encoding is not 
        specified, the cmdlet will attempt to auto-detect the encoding by reading 
        the first character from the file. If no character haven't been written 
        to the file yet, the cmdlet will default to using Unicode encoding. You 
        can override this behavior by explicitly specifying the encoding via the 
        Encoding parameter. 
        
    Set-FileTime
        Sets a file or folder's created and last accessed/write times. 
        
    Get-FileVersionInfo
        Attempts to get the FileVersionInfo object for the specified path. 
        Usually only executable files include file version information. 
        
    Get-ForegroundWindow
        Returns the hWnd or handle of the window in the foreground on the current 
        desktop. See also Set-ForegroundWindow. 
        
    Set-ForegroundWindow
        Given an hWnd or window handle, brings that window to the foreground. 
        Useful for restoring a window to uppermost after an application which 
        seizes the foreground is invoked. See also Get-ForegroundWindow 
        
    Write-GZip
        Create GNU ZIP (GZIP) format files from pipeline or parameter input. 
        
    New-Hardlink
        Creates filesystem hard links. The hardlink and the target must reside on 
        the same NTFS volume. 
        
    Get-Hash
        Gets the hash value for the specified file or byte array via the 
        pipeline. The default hash algorithm is MD5, although you can specify 
        other algorithms using the -Algorithm parameter (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, 
        SHA384, SHA512 and RIPEMD160). This cmdlet emits a HashInfo object that 
        has properties for Path, Algorithm, HashString and Hash. 
        
    Format-Hex
        The Format-Hex command displays the contents of the specified files in 
        hex format. This cmdlet will also accept pipeline input in the form of a 
        byte stream. The output can be controlled via various parameters to 
        indicate the number of columns that should be displayed or alternatively 
        you can specify the width of the output. The header, address and ASCII 
        portions of the display can also be turned off individually. The offset 
        and count can also be specified via parameters to control where in the 
        input to start displaying and how much to display. 
        
    Ping-Host
        Sends ICMP echo requests to network hosts. 
        
    Resolve-Host
        Resolves host names to IP addresses. 
        
    Get-HttpResource
        Gets an HTTP resource or optionally the headers associated with the 
        resource. 
        
    New-Junction
        Creates NTFS directory junctions. 
        
    Get-LoremIpsum
        
    ConvertTo-MacOs9LineEnding
        Converts the line endings in the specified file to Mac OS9 and earlier 
        style line endings "\r". You can convert a single file to a new file 
        name. Or you can convert multiple files and specify a destination 
        directory. By default, this cmdlet will overwrite existing files unless 
        you specify -NoClobber. If you want to force the overwrite of read only 
        files use the -Force option. 
        
    ConvertTo-Metric
        
    Get-MountPoint
        Returns all mount points defined for a specific root path. 
        
    Remove-MountPoint

        Purges all messages from a queue 
        
    Get-MSMQueue
        Returns a list of all queues matching the filter parameters 
        
    New-MSMQueue
        Creates a new queue object with the defined properties 
        
    Receive-MSMQueue
        Receives the first message available in the queue. This call is 
        synchronous, and blocks the current thread of execution and waits until 
        either a message is available in the queue, or the time-out expires. 
        
    Send-MSMQueue
        Wraps an object in a Message, and places it onto the defined queue. 
        
    Test-MSMQueue

        and/or the end of a sequence. 
        
    Get-OpticalDriveInfo
        Get information on optical drive capabilities on the local machine. 
        
    Add-PathVariable
        Adds the specified paths to the end of the named, path-oriented 
        environment variable by taking the paths specified by the Value parameter 
        and concatenating them into a semi-colon separated string. The paths can 
        be prepended to the environment variable by using the -Prepend switch 
        parameter. 
        
    Get-PathVariable
        Gets the specified path-oriented environment variable and outputs an 
        array of strings. One string for each path. The environment variable 
        string is split a semi-colon and you can option specify that empty paths 
        be removed and unnecessary quotes be removed from each path. 
        
    Set-PathVariable
        Sets the specified path-oriented environment variable by taking the paths 
        specified by the Value parameter and concatenating them into a semi-colon 
        separated string. 
        
    Get-PEHeader
        The PE header for Windows executables includes various useful bits of 
        information including the image base address, subsystem, linker version, 
        etc. 
        
    Get-Privilege

        Creates shell shortcuts. 
        
    Get-ShortPath
        Gets the short, 8.3 name for the given path. This cmdlet emits a 
        ShortPathInfo object that contains a ShortPath property as well as a Path 
        property which contains the original long path. 
        
    Send-SmtpMail
        Sends email via specified SMTP server to specified recipients. This 
        cmdlet checks for existence of several preference that if set can make 
        this cmdlet much easier to use. Those preference variables are: * 
        $PscxSmtpHostPreference="smtp.example.net" * $PscxSmtpPortPreference=587 
        * $PscxSmtpFromPreference="john_doe@example.net"

        later. 
        
    Get-TabExpansion
        This command provides access to the PSCX tab expansion engine. If you are 
        not using the PSCX profile, call this command from your TabExpansion 
        function. 
        
    Start-TabExpansion
        Initializes the caches used by Get-TabExpansion. These may include the 
        .NET namespace and type cache, the WMI class cache, and more. 
        
    Write-Tar
        Create Tape Archive (TAR) format files from pipeline or parameter input. 
        
    Disconnect-TerminalSession
        Disconnects a specific remote desktop session on a system running 
        Terminal Services/Remote Desktop 
        
    Get-TerminalSession
        Gets information on terminal services sessions. 
        
    Stop-TerminalSession
        Logs off a specific remote desktop session on a system running Terminal 
        Services/Remote Desktop 
        
    Get-TypeName
        Get-TypeName displays the typename of the input object. Normally you 
        would use Get-Member to determine this but if you are only interested in 
        the type name this filter produces much less output. Also, since 
        Get-Member accumulates multiple instances of the same type into a single 
        output record for that type, you don't get any sense of how many objects 
        of that type are traversing the pipeline. With Get-TypeName, you will see 
        the type name of *every* object passed into it. NOTE: If you specify any 
        arguments then all pipeline input is ignored. This is due to the fact 
        that PowerShell executes the Process function even if there isn't any 
        input so it is impossible to distinguish between $null pipeline input and 
        no pipeline input. NOTE: the type name is displayed directly to the host 
        so that it doesn't interfere with pipeline operations. If you want the 
        original object to pass thru, use the PassThru parameter. 
        
    ConvertTo-UnixLineEnding
        Converts the line endings in the specified file to Unix line endings 
        "\n". You can convert a single file to a new file name. Or you can 
        convert multiple files and specify a destination directory. By default, 
        this cmdlet will overwrite existing files unless you specify -NoClobber. 
        If you want to force the overwrite of read only files use the -Force 
        option. 
        
    Get-Uptime
        Gets the operating system's uptime and last bootup time. 
        
    Test-UserGroupMembership
        Tests whether or not a user (current user by default) is a member of the 
        specified group name. This can be used to test whether a user is admin or 
        elevated to admin. 
        
    Set-VolumeLabel
        Modifies the label shown in Windows Explorer for a particular disk 
        volume. 
        
    ConvertTo-WindowsLineEnding
        Converts the line endings in the specified file to Windows line endings 
        "\r\n". You can convert a single file to a new file name. Or you can 
        convert multiple files and specify a destination directory. By default, 
        this cmdlet will overwrite existing files unless you specify -NoClobber. 
        If you want to force the overwrite of read only files use the -Force

UTILITY APPLICATIONS
    Less-394
        Less-394 is a paging utility that PSCX installs. PSCX further provides
        a replacement "help" function that can uses the installed less.exe to 
        page help output. If you use either the "man" alias (an alias to help) 
        or the help function, the output will be paged using the PSCX "less"
        function which uses less.exe. By default, PSCX's "less" function will 
        use Less.exe to page its input.  If you want to temporarily avoid 
        using Less for paging when viewing help topics, you can use Get-Help 
        directly e.g.:
        
        PS> Get-Help Get-PSDrive -Full
        
        The primary commands you need to know in order to use less.exe are:
        Press 'q' to exit less.exe.  Press '/<some_term>[enter] to search the
        help topic for a specific term.  Press 'h' to get more help on how to 
        use less.exe.
        
        If you want to permanently suppress the usage of Less and revert back
        to PowerShell's default pager (more.com) set the 'PageHelpUsingLess' 
        preference variable to $false in your Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1 file.
        See the PREFERENCES VARIABLES section above for more information on
        customing PSCX.
               
        Using Less to browse help topics is significantly nicer than the 
        default paging in PowerShell. PSCX does not however redefine 
        PowerShell's "more" function to use Less because the way PowerShell 
        interops with legacy applications causes all output to be rendered to 
        text before it is sent to a legacy application. That makes commands 
        like the following take too much time to generate any output:
        
        PS> gci $env:windir -rec | less
        
    EchoArgs
        This is a simple legacy console application that can be very useful 
        when you are troubleshooting the invocation of a legacy application
        with complex parameters.  The typical problem is that you may think 
        the parameters are being passed literally to the legacy application 
        when in fact PowerShell is parsing the parameters via its standard
        parameter parsing and then passing the result to the legacy 
        application e.g.:
        
        PS> echoargs a /b -c -d:user /e:foo.cs;405
        Arg 0 is <a>
        Arg 1 is </b>
        Arg 2 is <-c>
        Arg 3 is <-d:user>
        Arg 4 is </e:foo.cs>

        405
        
        Notice that ';' is the statement separator in PowerShell so the '405' 
        part of the parameter '/e:foo.cs;405' is not even considered a 
        parameter to the legacy application.  These sort of problems are 
        typically solved by quoting the arguments to legacy applications e.g.:
        
        5> echoargs a /b -c -d:user '/e:foo.cs;405'
        Arg 0 is <a>
        Arg 1 is </b>
        Arg 2 is <-c>
        Arg 3 is <-d:user>
        Arg 4 is </e:foo.cs;405>
